																		Shittp!

================================================================================

Yet another HTTP library! We need more HTTP libraries! There aren't enough HTTP
libraries! We're running out of HTTP libraries!

- No dependencies!
- Uses jamerror for error handling! (https://github.com/jkeveren/jamerror)
- Bad! It's literally called shittp! don't use this software! This is just for
  me and my bullshit only! No real projects allowed!
- For C++ and maybe C in the future but definitely not because I really like
  C++ and therefore don't really use C that much anymore! Maybe other
  languages at some point also!
